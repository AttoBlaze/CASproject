TODO:

Formal functions (of which will exist:
    floor, ceil, round, abs, root, random, gamma
)

More Simplifications
Factorial operator, modulus operator

Simplification settings:
ContractionMode:
    None - expandable/contractable expressions are kept as-is
    Expand - expressions are expanded when possible (fx a*(b+c)=a*b+a*c)
    Contract - expressions are contracted when possible (fx a*b+c*b=(a+c)*b)

Refactor ContainsAny- input is string
Refactor Equals to make possible to just check under arguments for specific functions- maybe use  

Create own BigDecimal library focused on performance?
