TODO:

Expansions:
	Formal functions: floor, ceil, round, abs, root, random, gamma
	More Simplifications
	Factorial operator, modulus operator

	Simplification settings:
		ContractionMode:
			None - expandable/contractable expressions are kept as-is
			Expand - expressions are expanded when possible (fx a*(b+c)=a*b+a*c)
			Contract - expressions are contracted when possible (fx a*b+c*b=(a+c)*b)

Refactorings:
	ContainsAny refactor
	Refactor Equals to make possible to just check under arguments for specific functions- check sequential under arguments

Features: 
	Plotting:
		Function plotting
		Point plotting
		Line/segment plotting

	Evaluate with only specific objects
	Evaluate with a specific list of objects

Ideas: 
	Create own BigDecimal library focused on performance?
	Complex numbers
	Simple integration
