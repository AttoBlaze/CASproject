TODO:

Formal functions (of which will exist:
    floor, ceil, round, abs, root, random, gamma
)
Big floating point, Precision setting: 
	Constants have 2 fields; doble and exponent.
	Calculation is done in custom class taking constant arguments.
	Calculation class defines wether double or bigfloat is used.

Simplification settings:
DisolveConstants - disolve predefined constants (replace with their value) on evaluation
DisolveFractionConstants - constants in fractions are combined
ContractionMode:
    None - expandable/contractable expressions are kept as-is
    Expand - expressions are expanded when possible (fx a*(b+c)=a*b+a*c)
    Contract - expressions are contracted when possible (fx a*b+c*b=(a+c)*b)
CalculateOnDefine - calculate when defining objects
